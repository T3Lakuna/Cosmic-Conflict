Redo health bars (better shield display, hopefully bars > numbers, hide shields when invisible, add background, add champ name and level, make NOT scale size with champ size, make not turn awkwardly).
Client and matchmaking, including custom lobbies.
Minions and towers, plus their "AI."
Inhibitor and nexus actions.
Fountains. Respawning.
Re-write champion README while making a champion so that it's all-inclusive, including things such as "model the champion," preferably in a step-by-step order. Also include a recap at the end, i.e. "make sure the champion model has a mesh renderer, the champion script, a rigidbody, etc."
Balance turrets.
Make stat guidelines.
Items.
Waypoints, including those for champion spawning, minion movement, and monster/boss spawning.

Improvements to make when rewriting:
- Extra parameters for static methods
- Combine auto attack and movement commands to be more like League. Also, attack-move. When there is an auto target, the player should move towards the target when they're out of range instead of forgetting them.
- Better map.
- More clear split between ability and ability instance.
- Improved death recap and attack/ability logging (also helps with tower/minion targeting AI :D).
- Maybe split up MatchManager a bit. Waypoint-storer class to hold references to waypoints, which should be stored as empty gameobjects instead of vector2s.
- Extra properties in entity such as "champion" and "structure" to reduce lag (by calling GetComponent<Type>() less).
