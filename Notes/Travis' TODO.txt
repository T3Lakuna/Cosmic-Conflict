Must be done before alpha:
- Client.
- Matchmaking, including custom lobbies.
- Photon stuff.
- Inhibitor and nexus death effects.
- Fountains.
- Respawning.
- Items.
- Boss and monster spawn waypoints.
- Jungle monsters and bosses.

Other things preferably done before end of project:
- Health bars.
- Fog of war.
- Chat.
- Attack-move.
- Combine attacking and moving into a single action.

Improvements to make when rewriting:
- Extra parameters for static methods.
- Better map.
- More clear split between ability and ability instance.
- Improved death recap and attack and ability logging.
- Split up MatchManager.
- Clean waypoints.
- Extra properties in Entity to store subclasses.
- Auto attacking as a setting. Can use current tower/minion targeting.
- Utilize abstraction.
- Basic entity sample to modify for all non-structure entities.
- Toggleable combat UI which contains health bars and activates smart camera mode.
- Make all entity models' positions be based on the center of the model.
