Character design - one of those Chinese latern with a little face ya dig?
Lots of Chinese influence

Playstyle - Support/more of a mage/ jungler? pretty much anyone that can nae nae because of vision abuse

Passive - Illumination 
Gives passive move speed and increased vision when in the fog of war

Q - Firework fisticuffs
Straight line skillshot that if hit has the ability to recast with an increasingly shorter range

W- Silk shield
Just a spell shield but it takes a second to like fully active 

E- In the clouds
Slow moving knock up that when used through the W gains big time increased range also this is not very good without the W and it shouldn't be that long of a knock up

Ult- The lion's bite
Giant lion fang that shoots in a straight line and if it hits a wall it stuns, this move pushes the opposing champs until they hit a wall

Strengths - Good cc, very good at jungling and invading

Weaknesses - No escape (regular ass mage), squishy as all hell, has to have room to work and all abilities to have even a small chance to peel
