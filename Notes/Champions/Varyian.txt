- Passive ability/abilities.
Passive - Varyian does more percent damage the more champions around

- Three normal abilities, unless the kit requires something different (i.e. Nidalee basically has 6, three for each form).
Q - Varyian strikes with his greatsword, a skillshot like ability that pierces, the enemies pierced later take more damage (Senna Q, low damage base but if it hits a lot good damage at the end)
W - Varyian is thrilled by the exciteAuto Empowerment, next 3 autos have higher damage, higher damage than that if the target hits a different target then since starting (so Target 1, T2, T2 does more damage than T1, T1, T1, and T1, T2, T3 does more than that)
E - Throws his Sword, Has a circle with a cone attached, Varyians sword lands in the circle and he dashes too it, he then pulls all enemies in the cone towards him (used to set up for w and q)

- Ultimate ability.
R - Varyian shouts, intimidating his opponents and feeding off their fear, Varyian gains damage and percent lifesteal for every enemy nearby as well as lowering nearby armor, scales with amount of enemies nearby
- Proposed champion strengths (i.e. high crowd control, high burst damage output, tanky, etc.).
-Very high teamfight presense, able to do damage to a large amount of enemies
-Would do well to roam fast

- Proposed champion weaknesses (i.e. immobile, squishy, low damage, etc.).
-Bad in duels and 1v1's, making hard laning phase but rewarding grouping/teamfight phase
-Bad against split pushing

-Varian Wrynn
-Stereotypical Barbarians/Warchiefs etc.

- Backstory.
"The tournament is set to replace wars for the ruling planets, however, never in the rules is it said only planetary members can enter.  Varyian is a fighter with no allegiance who delights in the thrill of battle, and gaining things from his conquests in the tournament are only more of an excuse to fight."
