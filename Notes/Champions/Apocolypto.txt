- Character theme- Aztec/Mayan Warrior

- Character playstyle uh???? Kinda weird summoner with a blowgun

- Passive ability- Baited Bolt- Apocolyptoâ€™s basic attacks give the target a debuff that makes all his summons move quicker towards them.

 -First ability- Summon Anaconda- Summon a swift anaconda to attack. The anaconda moves faster than all other summons. Anacondas attacks apply a small decaying slow. .

-Second ability- Summon Croc- Summon a sturdy crocodile. Crocodiles Can not attack but will intercept attacks.(like braum w) only 1 croc can exist but crocs will naturally take 5 autos to kill.

-Third ability-  Summon Poison Dart Frog-Summons a immobile frog. Frogs have ranged attacks that apply on hit effects. There can be multiple frogs out but no more than 5.

-Ultimate ability- Montezuma's Revenge- For the next 10 seconds Apocolpto and his summons gain 30% attack speed and each summon gains an additional effect if the ability is fully maxed.
 Snakes will multiply themselves. Crocs will gain Double the health. Frogs attacks will hit multiple enemies(ruaanns effect)

-Proposed champion strengths-Split pushing high dps lane control

- Proposed champion weaknesses- Squishy immobile mage.

Preferred:
- Name. Apocolypto 
- Design- A masked aztec Soothsayer with a blowgun and a staff that controls creatures
- Similar character references from other video games/movies/etc. Ah Puch(Mythology/Smite) 
- Backstory.- An ancient prophecy states that planets will collide and galaxys will be destroyed.
 Apocolpto will make sure all knows if this fate and will sacrifice those who do not believe in his words he spreads

-Note Honestly i feel as this character is kinda wack, I  Want the summons to be controled like its a unique unit. Idk if you want that or have the summons be ai.Kit may need to be changed in order to fit if its ai or not.
