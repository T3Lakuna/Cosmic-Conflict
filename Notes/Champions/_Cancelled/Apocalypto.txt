Strengths
	High wave clear, sustain damage, and self-peel.
Weaknesses, Counters, and Counterplay
	Low durability, no mobility. Susceptible to burst damage and long-ranged enemies.

Denied. Sustain-damage champions with self-peel are inherently unbalanced, and "turret" abilities are unfun to play with or against.
