- Character theme Elemental of Earth
- Character playstyle High engage support/ toplaner

-  Passive-  Tremble-  After casting any ability Slamboski causes a small quake around him stunning nearby enemies for 0.5 seconds. Does very low amounts of damage

-First Ability- Earthmothers Call- Slamboski slams the ground in front of him and after 1 second delay an earth wall that is slightly horseshoe shaped. If the wall would hit the enemy from below it would push them outwards with a small knock up.( like trundle e) this move has a cast time that can be stopped by cc. Added points into this ability make the horseshoe shaped more promedent.

-Second Ability- Collasal Smash- Slamboski brings his fists together in a small aoe in front of him. Enemies hit by this ability have their armor and mr reduced by 30% percent for up to 6 seconds(duration increases by points into the ability) The aoe is as large as his passives.

-Third Ability- Wall Jump-  Only castable if Slamboski is near any terrain. Slamboski takes a half second to climb up the wall. After that, he launches himself off the wall towards any direction dealing damage to any enemies along the way. This ability has a fairly large range(thinking 1 and a half ornn dashes). His passive will activate when/if he reaches max distance. He can be stunned during the dash and will cancel his passive.

-Ultimate Ability-  Magnitude Punch- Slamboski winds up a punch aimed towards the ground.
When he lands the punch it will cause an aoe knock up. 
Every half second the punch increases in magnitude with a maximum of 5 seconds until it will naturally be cast. 
Each increase in magnitude  will increase the abilities range, damage and knock up duration. 
Each level of magnitude will grant larger benefits.( Aka the jump from level 7 magnitude from 6 gives more bonuses than the jump from 2 to 3.)   
Any sort of cc will cause the ability to be cast at whatever magnitude it is currently at(except silences which will instead cancel and reset cooldown).
Slamboski can not manually cancel the ability early.

- Proposed champion strengths- Insane Crowd control and very strong tankyness
- Proposed champion weaknesses- High Cooldowns and mana costs on abilities. Most abilities could be canceled early.

Preferred:
- Name- Slamboski the Valley Shaper

- Similar character references from other video games/movies/etc.Much like a very risky version of Earthshaker from Dota
