He's a bullet but he has a gun boomerang

Playstyle- Ranged Carry

Abilities:
Passive- Throws out pistol like a boomerang. Can't attack until he gets the gun back. As he levels up he can throw more guns at once. Higher scaling on auto attacks
Q- Throws out a rifle like a boomerang that shoots at the closest/lowest heath enemy when at its crest (low damage but maybe have an execute). Rifle itself also does damage if it hits an enemy
W- Buffs gunmerang by allowing it to shoot as it flies. 3-5 auto attacks or something
E- Throws a flashbang that explodes on after a short delay, slows and does damage to nearby enemies
R- Pulls out a cannon and fires a cannonball at a location. Knocks back and does damage to enemies in the area 

Strengths-
Plays well into late game due to passive. High dps. Cool as hell.
Weaknesses-
Squishy. No cc. No movement.

Found a gun but doesn't know how it works. Parents lost forever after they got shot. Looking for them.
