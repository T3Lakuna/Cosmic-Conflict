Unwilling sacrifice 
Restores health and mana upon damage of an enemy (has a cooldown.) after 5 successful "sacrifices" the champ enters Dominant Takeover where the elder god takes full control over their host and boosts the damage of the vessel. (can't gain any stacks of sacrifice during Dominant Takeover) 
- Three normal abilities, unless the kit requires something different.
Q- Eldritch Blast: Dark Energy is blasted forward inside of a beam that ends in an area of effect death area that's a square. Inside of that square enemies are slowed and take damage
W-  Contempt: auto attack reset does more damage to lower health enemies
E- Unrelenting Grasp. It's a pull idk what else to say it's just a pull

- Ultimate ability.
Inconceivable power:
Dominant power immediately activates upon initial cast. recast ult to smash down a large tentacle which does execute damage if kills able to recast ult again.
- Proposed champion strengths (i.e. high crowd control, high burst damage output, tanky, etc.).
Strong laning good teamfights falls off late okay tank good damage output
- Proposed champion weaknesses (i.e. immobile, squishy, low damage, etc.).
Immobile easily kited low damage if Dominant Takeover isn't active

Preferred:
- Jayden
- Concept art or lookalike references. Kurt Russell from The Thing
- Kinda like Darius And Swain mixed together
- an Elder God inhabits his body and controls him and lends him a small amount of the Elder Gods immaculate power without the knowledge or consent of Jayden.
