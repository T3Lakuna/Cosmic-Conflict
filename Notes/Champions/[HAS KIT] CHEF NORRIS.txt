- Character theme (i.e. post-apocalyptic, pirate, etc.).
He's a really good chef
- Character playstyle (i.e. assassin, supportive, mage, etc.).
Mage-Like Support
- Passive ability/abilities.
Good Eats- Using any of his abilities grants him and the target ally movement speed scaling off level
- Three normal abilities, unless the kit requires something different (i.e. Nidalee basically has 6, three for each form).
Q- Spicy Chicken Teriyaki- Target ally (all abilities can be cast on himself) gains movement speed and auto attacks burn the enemy for a bit
W- Steak and Eggs- Target ally loses movement speed but gains a big shield that goes away after a bit
E- Double Decker Cheeseburger- Target ally gains adaptive damage and a burst of attack speed for a short while. Can be cast twice (doesnt stack)
- Ultimate ability.
R- All You Can Eat Buffet- Target ally gains a small boost in damage, attack speed, movement speed, and health regen. Can be cast up to 3 times. (doesnt stack) 
- Proposed champion strengths (i.e. high crowd control, high burst damage output, tanky, etc.).
Really good at buffing allies and giving them an advantage in fights
- Proposed champion weaknesses (i.e. immobile, squishy, low damage, etc.).
Low movement so he can be cc'd easily, hes fairly squishy, and he himself is bad at fighting, as his abilities can only target allies.
Preferred:
- Name- Chef Norris
- Concept art or lookalike references- Chuck Norris in a chefs outfit
- Similar character references from other video games/movies/etc- Kinda like butcher olaf but more chuck norris like
- Backstory- He's on a mission to travel around the world to win every possible cooking competition there is while also beating up communists for fun
