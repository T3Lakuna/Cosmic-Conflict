When designing a new champion, make sure of the following:
Champion script must call SetupChampion() in the start method. That should be all that is necessary.
Entity models must include the following:
- Mesh filter.
- Mesh renderer.
- Mesh collider.
- Rigidbody (no gravity, not kinematic).
- Champion script.
- Layer set to Ignore Raycast.
Ability models must include the following:
- Mesh filter.
- Mesh renderer.
- Mesh collider (is trigger).
- NO SCRIPT. Script is added on-creation.
- Layer set to Ignore Raycast.
Also preferable:
- Splash art.
- An icon for each ability (passive, primary, secondary, tertiary, ultimate).
- Voice lines.
